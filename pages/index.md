# Analog Money Documentation

Welcome to the public documentation for Analog Money. This repository contains guides and resources for developers to run, test, and verify the Analog Money platform components independently.

## Overview

This documentation covers:

- **Frontend**: How to run the self-hosted interface locally.
- **Contracts**: How to compile, test, and deploy the smart contracts.

## Getting Started

- [Running the Frontend](./frontend.md)
- [Working with Contracts](./contracts.md)

## Self-Hosting

Analog Money is designed to be transparent and verifiable. These guides provide the necessary instructions to run the entire stack on your own infrastructure, ensuring you can interact with the protocol directly without relying on our hosted interfaces.
